Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity or expression (masculine, feminine, other) is different from their sex (male, female) at birth. Gender identity refers to one’s internal understanding of one’s own gender, or the gender with which a person identifies. Gender expression is a term used to describe people’s outward presentation of their gender.
Gender identity and sexual orientation are different facets of identity. Everyone has a gender identity and a sexual orientation, but a person’s gender does not determine a person’s sexual orientation. Transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or none of the above.

These activities aimed to:

Prevent and control factors that increase the risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as poor nutrition and physical inactivity.
Raise diabetes awareness.
Promote diabetes self-management.
Improve outcomes and quality of life for those living with diabetes in high-risk communities and regions across the country.
